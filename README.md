Fuel-Cell-Car
=============

1A Mechatronics Fuel Cell Car Project
This was a collaborative project between:
Ashwyn Chadha
Yaning Tan
Jenny Dong
Rayyan Ghani

For the end of term project for our 1A term, the team worked on a small RC car. The car was given to us by the Engineering Clinic at the University of Waterloo. It was modified and developed for using the IAR-Embedded Workbench. The language used for development was C++. The car was powered by a small hydrogen fuel cell, and is programmed to follow a black line over an obstacle course. It was also modified by hard-coding it to specific courses that we had to traverse as part of the end-of-term evaluation, and successfully traversed each of the obstacle courses.

There were some fun times spent while working on this car, and also some frustrating situations. Some artwork was also made, along with a theme. Enthusiasm while ad showing that we had fun while working was an important part of the project.
